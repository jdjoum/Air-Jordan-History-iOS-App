    Sneaker(title: "Air Jordan 1", headline: "The First Air Jordan Sneaker Ever Released", image: "AJ1", gradientColors: [Color("ColorRedLight"), Color.black], description: "An Iconic Air Jordan Sneaker With A Timeless Design That Sneaker Fans Love!\n\nAir Jordan (sometimes abbreviated AJ) is an American brand of basketball shoes, athletic, casual, and style clothing produced by Nike. It was created for Hall of Fame basketball player and six-time NBA Finals MVP Michael Jordan. The original Air Jordan sneakers were produced exclusively for Michael Jordan in late 1984, and released to the public on April 1, 1985. The shoes were designed for Nike by Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield, and Bruce Kilgore. The red and black colorway of the Nike Air Ship, the prototype for the Jordan I, was later outlawed by then-NBA Commissioner David Stern for having very little white on them (this rule, known as the \"51 percent\" rule, was repealed in the late 2000s). After the Nike Air Ship was banned, Michael Jordan and Nike introduced the Jordan I in colorways with more white, such as the \"Chicago\" and \"Black Toe\" colorways. They used the Nike Air Ship's ban as a promotional tool in advertisements, hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage. Since then, Jordan Brand has elevated to household notoriety with star-struck collaborations and very unique limited releases.", designYear: "1984", definingMoment: "AJ1-DM"),
    Sneaker(title: "Air Jordan 2", headline: "The Only Air Jordan Sneaker Without an OG Black Colorway", image: "AJ2", gradientColors: [Color("ColorRedLight"), Color("ColorRedDark")], description: "The success of the Air Jordan I encouraged Nike to release a new Air Jordan in 1986 for the new basketball season. Designed by Peter Moore and Bruce Kilgore, the original Air Jordan II was unique in that it was made in Italy. The Air Jordan II introduced better cushioning with a polyurethane midsole and a full length encapsulated Nike air bubble for maximum comfort. The Air Jordan II was the first Jordan not to have the Nike swoosh on the upper. The Air Jordan II originally retailed at $100 and was released from 1986 to 1987. The shoe later re-released in 1994, 2004–2005, 2008, 2010, 2014–2018.", designYear: "1986", definingMoment: "AJ2-DM"),
    Sneaker(title: "Air Jordan 3", headline: "The Shoe That Micheal Jordan Won the 1988 NBA Slam Dunk Contest In!", image: "AJ3", gradientColors: [Color("ColorRedLight"), Color.black], description: "The Air Jordan III was designed in 1988 by Tinker Hatfield, who works for Nike as a designer for stores and offices. By that time Michael Jordan was ready to leave Nike, but the Jordan III changed his mind. It was the first Air Jordan to feature a visible air unit on the heel, the new Jumpman logo, an elephant print trim and tumbled leather to give it a luxury look. The Air Jordan III was also famous for the humorous ads depicting film director Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, the character he played in his film \"She's Gotta Have It\". This campaign was known as \"Mars and Mike\", which was one of Nike's most successful advertisement campaigns. These were the first Jordans to feature the \"NIKE AIR\" logo on the back. These were said to be Michael Jordan's favorite shoes, he wore them during the 1988 NBA Slam Dunk Contest and many other events in his basketball career.", designYear: "1988", definingMoment: "AJ3-DM"),

Designed by Tinker Hatfield, it was the first Air Jordan released on the global market. It had four colorways: White/Black, Black/Cement Grey, White/Fire Red-Black, and Off White/Military Blue. Nike featured director and actor Spike Lee in ads for the AJ IV. Lee had featured the shoe in his movie \"Do The Right Thing\". Michael Jordan wore the Air Jordan IV when he made \"The Shot\", a series winner in Game 5 of the 1989 NBA First Round between the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

    Sneaker(title: "Air Jordan 5", headline: "The Air Jordan Inspired by a World War 2 Mustang Fighter Jet!", image: "AJ5", gradientColors: [Color("ColorRedLight"), Color.black], description: "The Air Jordan V was released in February 1990, designed by Tinker Hatfield again. Some elements were carried over from the Air Jordan IV, but overall they were a completely new look. Some of its new features include a reflective tongue (with a unique protruding design and look), translucent rubber soles and lace locks. The soles gave them a new look, but yellowed over time when exposed to moisture and were the source of many complaints early on due to the slippery nature of the soles when collecting dust. Hatfield is believed to have drawn inspiration for the Air Jordan V from World War II fighter planes, which was most notably visible in the shark teeth shapes on the midsole. The Air Jordan V was reintroduced in 2000, including a new colorway featuring Michael Jordan's high school (Laney High) colors. ", designYear: "1990", definingMoment: "AJ5-DM"),

This shoe introduced the huarache technology which allowed the shoes to better conform to the user's foot. A few things were no longer featured on the new model, such as the visible air sole, the Nike Air logo, and the translucent soles. This was the first Air Jordan in the line that did not have any distinctive 'Nike Air' on the outer portions of the shoe. The 'Nike Air' branding was still on the in-soles, which Air Jordans VIII–XI also had. The VIIs were also known for a successful ad campaign in which Bugs Bunny appeared alongside Michael Jordan to market the shoes.", designYear: "1992", definingMoment: "AJ7-DM"),

Hatfield and Nike discouraged Jordan from playing in them, but once they were produced, he couldn't resist. Also noteworthy, Jordan violated league dress code by wearing the shoes, as his teammates wore all-black shoes. It wasn't the first time Jordan had run afoul of NBA footwear rules, having broken them with his very first signature shoe in 1985. He was fined $5,000 for not following the Bulls' colorway policy with the AJ XI. After the fine, Nike made him a pair of the shoes in a black/white/concord colorway for the series against Orlando.", designYear: "1995", definingMoment: "AJ11-DM"),
